**‚ÑπÔ∏è Important:** If your language is not Japanese, you do not need to translate and write the description in Japanese.
The accuracy of translation into Japanese is not high, so it will be easier for us to understand if you write it in the original language.
It will also allow the reader to use the translation tool of their preference if necessary.
